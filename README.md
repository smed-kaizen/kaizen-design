# kaizen-design
This repo contains the design of the application and the engineering done before-hand.

# Motivation:
I finished my work one day, and I was faced with this free time that I had. I felt like I could do 
whatever I wanted, learn anything I wanted, but I wasn't looking forward to it. The feeling of
accomplishment that I had at school once I learned a new theorem and solved new problems just disappeared. Now that I have
a lot of free time, I want it to be worthwhile. I want to do things that matter to me. I want to make my life enjoyable.

When you are this deep in sadness, you can't help but think of the times when you had fun. For me, the most fun I had has been
when playing challenging video games. When I level up and clear new levels. When I become better at the game. And that's
when this idea struck me: "What if life was a game as well?", at least the free time part of it. What if I can bring the
feeling of continuous challenge and improvement back to my life? What if I can challenge the old me and become better each
day? 

# Introduction:
I remember back at school, I used to make these tables where the rows represent the seven days and the columns represent
the 24 hours I had in each day. I would describe my whole week and try to plan what subject should I study at what time.
I always ended up over-estimating myself and not being able to respect this timetable. But I would try again and create a
new table in the next week. Spoiler-alert: I couldn't respect that as well.

I always thought of planning my tasks as: "I have to plan at least this amount of tasks a day". My human nature would get
the best of me and the plan was not entirely respected no matter how relaxed I made it.

What if my thought process was not efficient? instead of thinking of the minimum that I have to do a day, what if I think
of the maximum that I should do a day? What if I limit the amount of tasks that I have to do? would that make the process
a bit easier? Will I focus more on the small amount of things that I had to do that day? This was the time when I first 
learned about this thing called Kaizen. It is a Japanese word that means: "Continuous small Improvement". In each day you
would do a tasks -no matter how small- towards becoming better in whatever field you wanted to do. This inspired me a lot,
and I wanted to implement this kaizen principle in my life in an enjoyable way.

This project is my personal approach and implementation to the kaizen principle in a fun way that motivates me and hopefully
other people to feel accomplished and motivated to follow the things we want in our short life spans.

# General Idea:
You have an amount of credit each day, Adding a task for the day will take some credit depending on how hard the task is (subjective).
Marking the task as done will add experience to the user. When the user reaches an amount of experience, he can level up
thus adding more credit and the ability to do more tasks. Not doing anything a day will cause the user to lose some exp.

It is possible to make some features available only after the users reaches a certain level.

# Index
This repo contains the following information with the order that they should be read:
1. [README](README.md): Motivation and introduction.
2. [REQUIREMENT](REQUIREMENT.md): Describes the functional and non-functional requirement.
3. [ANALYSIS AND DESIGN](ANALYSIS_&_DESIGN.md): Describes the requirements in detail and the approach to proceed. 
- assets/ : A directory that contains images or design saved files of the software used in the design (visual_paradigm).
